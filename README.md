HTML5 Synthesizer for canvas paintings

http://www.synthogram.com

Synthogram is an experiment in synthesizing drawings on a painting canvas.
      
It uses HTML5 Web Audio API, which enables sound synthesis in the browser. Because of that, it will only run on browsers that support it (such as Google Chrome).
